Week 3
I used Ai this week to help me understand GitHub better. I asked it questions such as how I can add code to it and save it to my files so I can have it. I also asked it questions about the quickest and best ways that I can add to my ai journal. It gave me very good explanations and walked me through it when I provided screenshots. https://chatgpt.com/c/68d44665-f378-832f-8ae0-1c062d784427 

I also used ai this week to ask it a medical related question about allergies.

Week 4

I used AI this week to help me plan trip with my friends for January. We are going to Europe for 2 weeks, I provided it with the dates we are going to be there and the countries we are visiting. I asked it to find cheap flights between each of the countries that we want to visit. I also asked it come up with activities to do in each of the countries. Overall, it was very helpful.
