Week 3
I used Ai this week to help me understand GitHub better. I asked it questions such as how I can add code to it and save it to my files so I can have it. I also asked it questions about the quickest and best ways that I can add to my ai journal. It gave me very good explanations and walked me through it when I provided screenshots. https://chatgpt.com/c/68d44665-f378-832f-8ae0-1c062d784427 

I also used ai this week to ask it a medical related question about allergies.
