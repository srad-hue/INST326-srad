Week 3
I used Ai this week to help me understand GitHub better. I asked it questions such as how I can add code to it and save it to my files so I can have it. I also asked it questions about the quickest and best ways that I can add to my ai journal. It gave me very good explanations and walked me through it when I provided screenshots. https://chatgpt.com/c/68d44665-f378-832f-8ae0-1c062d784427 

I also used ai this week to ask it a medical related question about allergies.

Week 4

I used AI this week to help me plan trip with my friends for January. We are going to Europe for 2 weeks, I provided it with the dates we are going to be there and the countries we are visiting. I asked it to find cheap flights between each of the countries that we want to visit. I also asked it come up with activities to do in each of the countries. Overall, it was very helpful.

Week 5

This week I used AI to ask it about the Government shutdown. I asked it questions such as if it was still going on, when it will end, and why it's happening. It gave me answers that I found very interesting. It was nice asking chatgpt questions on a topic that I was not educated on, and it giving me educated answers.

Week 6

This week I used AI to help me with a one way interview. This is when I was asked questions and I was given time to read it and respond. I told chatgpt about myself past experiences ad uploaded my resume so it would know about my work experience. Once I asked chat the questions from the interview it tailored it's responses to the things I told it about me. Was very helpful.

Week 7

This week I used chatgpt to help me figure out what something was called. I was at work and did not know what a security grille door was called. I took a picture of it and uploaded it to chatgpt, it took awhile for it to respond which made me a little frustrated. But it finally gave me and answer, I did a quick google search and it was correct. Was helpful but it did take awhile which was annoying.

Week 8

This week I used AI to help me write messages and format them. I wanted to send a nice note to my boss thanking her for her time and what she did for me. I told chatgpt about me and her, so that it could personalize something personal in order for me to send it to her. It came up with a nice personalized note for me to send her and i was very pleased with it.

Week 9

This week I used Chatgpt to help me keep track of my finances. I put in how much I make bi-weekly into chatgpt and how much I spend on my credit card and it's statement. Once I did this it told me that I was doing a good job and kept my spending low compared to my paychecks. It did something helpful, by telling me what to do with the extra money. It said I could invest it or put it in a savings account. Overall, I found it helpful.
